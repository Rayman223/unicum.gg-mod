"""Rating badges for Scaleform name fields, one image per value.

A player name field re-applies its own text format after the text is set
(CommonsLobby.formatPlayerName reads the field's format and passes it to
setTextFormat), so a <FONT COLOR> in the name is painted over and there is
no way to give text a background. Images are left alone, so the site's badge
-- a white number on its colour band -- is an image. Whole badges rather than
digits laid side by side: Scaleform leaves a seam between adjacent inline
images whatever hspace says, and every join showed.

They are drawn in the client, the first time a value is shown, into one
folder of resource files (badge_png.py; they used to ship all 30 000, 36 MB):

    gui/maps/icons/unicum/badges/wnx.3323.7a4fb2.png   "3 323" on its WNX band

The band's colour is in the name, so a scale the site changes draws new
badges rather than showing the old ones.

The client lists its resource folders as it starts: a file written into a
folder it knew loads at once, one in a folder created later does not until the
next start. So a marker file is written into the folder and asked of ResMgr:
if the client can load it, it can load the badges too; if not (the folder is
new, on the mod's first run), a rating is shown as its bare number until the
next start.
